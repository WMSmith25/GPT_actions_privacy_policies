1. Data Collection & Usage:
"This GPT Action processes your search queries, uploaded documents, and conversation history solely to provide research assistance (e.g., summarizing papers, finding articles on arXiv)."
"Your input data is used to generate responses but is not used to train OpenAI's foundational models unless you explicitly opt-in to data sharing for model improvement (if that feature is enabled)."
"We do not collect sensitive personal information (like SSNs, financial details) and advise against inputting such data." 
2. Data Sharing & Third Parties:
"Your data is kept within the OpenAI ecosystem. If an Action uses an external API (like fetching arXiv directly), data is sent only to that service to fulfill your request."
"We do not sell your data or share your specific queries/content with unrelated third parties for marketing." 
3. Data Retention & Security:
"User inputs and conversations are retained according to OpenAI's general policies, typically for a limited period (e.g., 30 days for non-Plus users) for system monitoring, unless you're a paid user with different settings."
"You can delete your chat history and data via your OpenAI account settings, which removes it from active use." 
4. User Control & Rights:
"You control your data. You can clear conversations, turn off chat history, and manage data sharing settings in your OpenAI account."
"You are responsible for the content you input and verify the accuracy/appropriateness of AI-generated summaries/content."
